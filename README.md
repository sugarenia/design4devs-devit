Hi, 

you’re reading this because you downloaded the files needed for the Design for Developers workshop in DEVit conference.

You can reuse the design provided as you see fit. It’d be great to use it as a base for your own designs! Send me what you came up with (you can find me as @sugarenia in Twitter).

If you need a more in-depth version of this workshop for your organization, send me an email at hello@sugarenia.com and we can arrange something.

Thanks for attending, you rock.
